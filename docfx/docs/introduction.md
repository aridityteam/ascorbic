# Introduction

Welcome to **AridityTeam.Ascorbic**!

Ascorbic is a runtime library that provides a variety of "useful" utilities, and extensions. Some of those utilities are taken from third-party code and modified to try to suit our needs on our software.

By contributing to this library, you are also helping us on improving our software, and we always appreciate that!
